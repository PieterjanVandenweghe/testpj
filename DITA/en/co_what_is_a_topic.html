      <p class="p">In DITA, all content is chunked into topics. Topics are individual units of information, organized around a single subject or answering a single question. Each topic makes sense on its own and can be authored as a stand-alone piece of content. A topic is considered the smallest information unit and multiple topics can be combined to create bigger information units (like chapters and volumes).</p>
      <div class="p" id="co_what_is_a_topic__p_wpz_ykq_tjb">A topic is traditionally composed of a title and some content. That content is built up of structural components, such as the following:<ul class="ul" id="co_what_is_a_topic__ul_efp_zkq_tjb">
            <li class="li">Paragraphs</li>
            <li class="li">Tables</li>
            <li class="li">Lists (bulleted lists, numbered steps …)</li>
            <li class="li">Illustrations</li>
            <li class="li">Notes ("Warning!", "Attention!", "Tip" …)</li>
         </ul></div>
      <p class="p" id="co_what_is_a_topic__p_e42_z4m_wjb">All the structural components of which your content consists are predefined in an <a class="xref" href="co_information_model.html">information model</a>. Technical writers working on the same project use this information model to ensure that all topics (that make up the final information product) are structured in the same manner.</p>
      <div class="example">
         <div class="p" id="co_what_is_a_topic__p_atl_2lq_tjb">The following topic answers the question “How do I take pictures in auto-adjustment mode?” It is composed of a title, some introductory sentences and a list of numbered steps.<figure class="fig fignone" id="co_what_is_a_topic__fig_nsb_glq_tjb">
