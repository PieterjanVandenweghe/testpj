      <p class="p" id="co_single_sourcing__p_ytl_5cx_tjb">Reusing content instead of copying it has the advantage that, in case of changes, you only need to modify the text once and it changes automatically in all places where the text occurs. This is at the same time its biggest disadvantage: you always need to check if the change applies to all places where the text occurs.</p>
